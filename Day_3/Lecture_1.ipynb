    "One of the most popular reasons why people learn Python is for how powerful and convenient it is to parse data. It has a collection of very powerful third-party packages that make data processing a breeze. Third party packages are simply a collection of useful code that other people have written, so that we don't have to anymore. Today, we will handle the following topics:\n",
    "- file  navigation and IO\n",
    "- pandas (see [the next notebook](./Lecture_2.ipynb))\n",
    "- seaborn (visualization [the next notebook](./Lecture_2.ipynb))\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning curve can be a bit steep, especially compared to how intuitive e.g. Excel is. However, once you're getting over the learning curve, the possibilities are endless.\n",

    "\n",
    "## File navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading in your data requires that you're able to locate it. Each file and folder on your computer has a unique path, that looks something like: `\"C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\my_project_final_REALLYfinal_v3.docx\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `\\` is the \"separator\", indicating that you're moving a level deeper into the filesystem. Note that Linux and MacOS have `/` as a separator.\n",

    "Navigating your files can be done with the `os` package, which is built into Python. You don't have to install this one yourself, you can just import it:"
