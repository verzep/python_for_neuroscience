    "In this project you will be provided with imaging data from an experiment in head-fixed mice. The data stem from two animals in which different regions of the hippocampus were recorded, the dentate gyrus (DG) and area CA1. For each animal you will get both, a continuous signal representing the Ca2+ level in the neurons and a binary signal representing detected Calcium events. The goal is to explore the neural activity of the two different regions on a basic level.\n",

    "- use numpy for basic arithmetic operations\n",
    "- plot histograms, timeseries, and box plots\n",
    "- generate an artifical spike train\n",

    "- get an impression of how Calcium imaging data look like\n",

    "1. Is the distribution of inter-event intervals (IEI) different between the two hippocampal areas?\n",
    "2. Are the IEI distributions different from one of a random poisson process? \n",
    "3. The binary signal is the result of a thresholding analysis, how well do you think it fits to the underlying continuous data?\n",
    "4. Is the average continuous signal of neurons with higher event rate indeed higher as expected?\n",

This helps to \"clean\" the signal from baseline drifts and the normalization step allows the comparison of signals from different neurons with different baseline signal intensities (e.g. due to different levels of sensor expression)."

The binary Ca^2+^ event data are marking onsets of Ca^2+^ events (not actual spikes) and hence we talk about inter-event intervals. Nevertheless, having this constraint in mind, the data can be used to draw some conclusions about neural activity.\n",
