In the case of Python, most of the time it is done by the interpreter deciding for himself what type a variable should be (which can cause some problems), _unless_ you specify the casting yourself. To do so, you can specify the casting with a constructor function (of the general form `typename()`), which will construct a variable of your desired type. For Python's fundamental types, there are only three castings/constructor types: `str()` for string, `int()` for integer and `float()` for floating point numbers."
